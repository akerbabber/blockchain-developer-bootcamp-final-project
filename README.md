Yet Another OTC, a decentralized otc desk for ERC20.

# What should my project do?
It is a dAPP that enables the exchange of ethereum tokens via a non-custodial smart contract.

# What is the project's workflow
1)Alice wants to sell a set of tokens outside the market (over the counter). She interacts with the smart contract creating a new sale and locks her tokens inside the contract. If she does not find any buyer she can destroy the sale and withdraw the tokens.   

2)Bob finds from the Yet Another OTC web interface that a new sale is open, if he wants to buy the set of tokens that Alice is selling he will propose an exchange. Doing so he will lock into the smart contract the tokens which he wants to exchange for Alice's one. If Alice does not answer at a time that Bob finds acceptable he can withdraw the offer and his assets. 

3)If Alice likes the offer she can confirm the sale and make the swap happen, she can then withdraw her new tokens.

4)Bob can now withdraw his new tokens.
